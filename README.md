# Python Script: Merge and Filter .txt Files

This Python script merges multiple `.txt` files from a specified folder, filters out empty lines and lines containing only numbers, and saves the merged content into a single `.txt` file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `merge.py` script.

2. Open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```shell
   python3 merge.py /path/to/folder

 - Replace `/path/to/folder` with the actual path to the folder containing the .txt files you want to merge.

4. The merged and filtered content will be stored in a file named `merged.txt`.
